AutoComplete For TinyMCE enables word autocompletion for the Wordpress Post Editor. Use it to type Faster and Error-Free.

== Description ==

It usually takes a bit to get into the writing flow, but once you get the grip it's a great tool to improve your entire writing process.

There is a complimentary On/Off button in the TinyMce Tool Bar, for fast toggling of the plugin in specific situations.

##Features

* Word Completion
* Intelligent algorithm to complete words using the previous word

**Note-** The plugin has a Settings Menu, named AutoComplete under the Settings Tab, which can be used to customize it behaviour. These settings are saved locally to each machine (browser, actually).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/autocomplete-for-tinymce` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings -> Autocomplete screen to configure the plugin (All settings/preferences are locally saved to user's machine, and are only applicable to that device).
